    /// Helper for objects that want to leave particles behind them as they
    /// move around the world. This emitter implementation solves two related
    /// problems:
    /// 
    /// If an object wants to create particles very slowly, less than once per
    /// frame, it can be a pain to keep track of which updates ought to create
    /// a new particle versus which should not.
    /// 
    /// If an object is moving quickly and is creating many particles per frame,
    /// it will look ugly if these particles are all bunched up together. Much
    /// better if they can be spread out along a line between where the object
    /// is now and where it was on the previous frame. This is particularly
    /// important for leaving trails behind fast moving objects such as rockets.
    /// 
    /// This emitter class keeps track of a moving object, remembering its
    /// previous position so it can calculate the velocity of the object. It
    /// works out the perfect locations for creating particles at any frequency
    /// you specify, regardless of whether this is faster or slower than the
    /// game update rate.
